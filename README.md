## Whats Churn Analysis???
Churn analysis is a critical tool for businesses seeking to sustain long-term growth. In today's highly competitive marketplace, the ability to retain customers is paramount. By examining customer data and identifying patterns associated with customer departures, businesses can proactively address issues and improve customer satisfaction. Through the application of advanced analytics and machine learning, organizations can predict which customers are likely to churn and understand the underlying factors driving their decisions. This insight enables companies to implement targeted strategies to enhance customer loyalty and reduce attrition, ultimately leading to improved financial performance.
Although this project focuses on churn analysis for a telecom firm, the techniques and insights are applicable across various industries. From retail and finance to healthcare and beyond, any business that values customer retention can benefit from churn analysis.
